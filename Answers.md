# Answer to Question 1

In the given diagram, the "Product" and "Product_Category" entities have a one-to-many relationship. Each record in the "Product_Category" table can be associated with multiple records in the "Product" table, as indicated by the "Product" table's foreign key "category_id" referencing the "id" in the "Product_Category" table. This relationship allows for proper categorization of products, ensuring that each product belongs to a specific category.

# Answer to Question 2

To ensure that each product in the "Product" table has a valid category assigned to it, you can enforce referential integrity through a foreign key constraint. This constraint would require the "category_id" column in the "Product" table to contain a valid "id" from the "Product_Category" table. If a record in the "Product" table is inserted or updated with an invalid "category_id", the database would reject the operation, preventing the creation of a product without a valid category.
